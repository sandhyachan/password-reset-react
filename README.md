## Password Reset Feature

One of the core features of this application is the **password reset functionality**. The process is designed to help users recover their account in case they forget their password or wish to update it. The password reset process is handled through two main pages:

1. **Forgot Password**: A page where users can request a password reset link by entering their email.
2. **Reset Password**: A page where users can set a new password once they've received a reset link.

### Forgot Password

The **Forgot Password** page allows users to request a password reset. Here's how it works:

- The user enters their registered **email address**.
- Once submitted, the system sends a password reset link to the user's email.
- If the email doesn't exist in the system, an error message is displayed.

### Reset Password

The **Reset Password** page is where users can set a new password. After receiving a valid reset link in their email, they can follow these steps:

- The user enters a **new password**.
- The password is validated to ensure it meets the minimum length requirement (at least 6 characters).
- The user is required to confirm the password by entering it again.
- If the passwords match, the userâ€™s password is updated in the system.

## Routes

The application uses **React Router** to handle navigation. Below are the available routes related to the password reset functionality:

- **/forgotpassword**: Allows users to submit their email address to receive a password reset link.
- **/resetpassword**: After clicking the reset link, users are redirected to this page to enter and confirm their new password.
